MMTOOLS

If you are running a multi monitor setup, there are certain things that could work better. Nvidia and ATI both have their own tools to handle this, but on my box the Nvidia desktop just isn't working as intended, so i wrote this.

FEATURES
Re-position the task switch (alt+tab)
Single display maximize
STATUS
The 0.6.1 release meant that the original idea is now implemented as intended. The next release will handle dialog's. Please report any issues to me, since these type of setups tend to differ.

CHANGELOG
0.6.1

Removed the timer and added detection of the task switch window creation
Added support for dialog created detection, will add centering support in the next release
Did some code cleanup
0.6.0

Initial Release
